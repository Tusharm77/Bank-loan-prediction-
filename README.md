Problem statement : This case is about a bank (Thera Bank) whose management wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors). A campaign that the bank ran last
year for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. This has encouraged the retail marketing department to devise campaigns with better target marketing to increase the success ratio with
minimal budget.

Approach:
The file Bank.xls contains data on 5000 customers. The data include customer demographic information (age, income, etc.), the customer's relationship with the bank (mortgage, securities account, etc.), and the customer response to the last personal loan campaign (Personal Loan). 
Among these 5000 customers, only 480 (= 9.6%) Accepted the personal loan that was offered to them in the earlier campaign.
We will implement Classification algorithms to differentiate people who will buy loans vs the who will not.

Here, I have performed basic EDA, pre-processing of data(cleaning, encoding etc.) to make the data ready. I have built various classification models using various techniques like
logistic regression, Naive Bayes, K-NN etc. and evaluated these models using metrics like precision, recall, accuracy, f1-score to arrive at the best model.
